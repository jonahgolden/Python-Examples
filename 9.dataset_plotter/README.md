This script, will read csv data and plot each column of the data on 
the same graph.  It will also save that graph in the same directory that you run this 
script from.  This script requires two arguments.  The first argument is the name of the 
csv file you want to plot, and the second argument is the file name that you want the 
graph to be saved as.  Not that this second argument should end in .pdf if you want it to
save as a pdf.  
To use this script, type the following into your terminal:
$ python Load_Plot.py InputFileName OutputFileName
