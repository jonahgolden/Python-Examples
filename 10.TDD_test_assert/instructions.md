## Assignment 10
### Debugging and Testing
**due at 12 noon on 2015-11-13** via Github

## Instructions

1. To start, [**fork**](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) this [repository](https://github.com/PHY3009/assignment_10).

2. [**Clone**](http://gitref.org/creating/#clone) the repository to your computer.

3. Use test-driven development (TDD) to write a function that is useful for your final 
project. The ipython notebook you submit must also include the test function which was 
used to develop the function you will apply to your final project. Both functions should 
contain docstrings and comments.

4. In a Markdown cell in the notebook please explain the purpose of the function in the 
context of the final project.

5. Demonstrate the usage of the function in the ipython notebook.

6. [**Push**](http://gitref.org/remotes/#push) the changes up to your copy of the 
repository on GitHub.

7. [Create a **pull request**](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) 
on the original repository to turn in the assignment.
