## Assignment 8
### Analyzing data
**due at 12 noon on 2015-11-06** via Github

## Instructions

1. To start, [**fork**](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) this [repository](https://github.com/PHY3009/assignment_8).

2. [**Clone**](http://gitref.org/creating/#clone) the repository to your computer.

3. Create an iPython notebook called `Regular_expressions_in_Python.ipynb` in which you 
choose one of the following options:
	
**Option 1: Clean up data related to your final project**	

	a. Load a dataset related to your proposal topic into an iPython notebook that could 
	benefit from some clean-up via regular expressions.
	
	b. In a markdown cell in the notebook clearly explain the problem with the dataset and
	how you could solve it with regular expressions.
	
	c. Use regular expressions in Python to solve the problem.

**Option 2: Clean up one of my datasets**	

	a. Load [this](https://github.com/PHY3009/assignment_8/blob/master/merged.dat) worm tracker dataset into an iPython notebook.
	
	b. In a markdown cell in the notebook clearly explain the problem with the dataset 
	(hint: look at the first column) and how you could solve it with regular expressions.
	
	c. Use regular expressions in Python to solve the problem.

4. [**Add**](http://gitref.org/basic/#add) and [**commit**](http://gitref.org/basic/#commit) 
changes to Git.

6. [**Push**](http://gitref.org/remotes/#push) the changes up to your copy of the 
repository on GitHub.

7. [Create a **pull request**](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) 
on the original repository to turn in the assignment.
