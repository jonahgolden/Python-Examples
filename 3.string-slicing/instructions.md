## Assignment 3
### Solving problems in Python 1
**due at 12 noon on 2015-10-29** via Github

## Instructions

1. To start, [**fork**](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) this [repository](https://github.com/PHY3009/assignment_3) if you want to work in the open, or go to a private copy of the repository on Github under the [PHY3009](https://github.com/PHY3009) organization that has your name.

2. [**Clone**](http://gitref.org/creating/#clone) the repository to your computer.

3. Create an iPython notebook called `problems_in_Python_1.ipynb` in which you answer the 
following questions:

a. Given a variable word = "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious", use slicing/string 
indexing to create 3 new variables. The first containing the word "super", the second 
containing the word "ice", & the last containing the word "us". Output the results with 
the `print` function.

b. Given a list of the even numbers from 1 - 10 inclusive, calculate the mean. Output the 
results with the `print` function. This should be done from scratch, not using Python 
functions that already exist.

c. Given a list of the even numbers from 1 - 10 inclusive, calculate the standard 
deviation. Output the results with the `print` function. This should be done from scratch, 
not using Python functions that already exist.

d. Given a list of the even numbers from 1 - 10 inclusive, calculate the standard error. 
Output the results with the `print` function. This should be done from scratch, not using 
Python functions that already exist.

e. Write code that takes your first name and your last name and add them together to give
your full name. Output the results with the `print` function. Note - there should be a 
space between you first and last name.

4. [**Add**](http://gitref.org/basic/#add) and [**commit**](http://gitref.org/basic/#commit) 
changes to Git.

6. [**Push**](http://gitref.org/remotes/#push) the changes up to your copy of the 
repository on GitHub.

7. [Create a **pull request**](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) 
on the original repository to turn in the assignment.
