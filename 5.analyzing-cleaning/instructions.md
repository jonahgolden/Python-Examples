## Assignment 5
### Analyzing data
**due at 12 noon on 2015-11-03** via Github

## Instructions

1. To start, [**fork**](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) this [repository](https://github.com/PHY3009/assignment_5).

2. [**Clone**](http://gitref.org/creating/#clone) the repository to your computer.

3. Create an iPython notebook called `Analyzing_data.ipynb` in which you address the 
following:
	
	a. Load a dataset related to your proposal topic into an iPython notebook using the 
	Python library you think is most appropriate for that dataset.
	
	b. Create a markdown cell in the notebook where you explain the following:
			* which Python library and command you used to load the dataset and why
			* which arguments you had to include in the command to successfully load the dataset and why you had to use them
			
	c. In addition to loading the data, use at least 3 of the pandas or numpy functions you 
	have learned about.
	
	d. Create another markdown cell in the notebook where you explain why you chose to use
	those functions on your dataset and what new information or insights you learned about 
	the dataset by using these functions.

4. [**Add**](http://gitref.org/basic/#add) and [**commit**](http://gitref.org/basic/#commit) 
changes to Git.

6. [**Push**](http://gitref.org/remotes/#push) the changes up to your copy of the 
repository on GitHub.

7. [Create a **pull request**](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) 
on the original repository to turn in the assignment.
