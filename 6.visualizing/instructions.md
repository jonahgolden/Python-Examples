## Assignment 6
### Analyzing data
**due at 12 noon on 2015-11-04** via Github

## Instructions

1. To start, [**fork**](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) this [repository](https://github.com/PHY3009/assignment_6).

2. [**Clone**](http://gitref.org/creating/#clone) the repository to your computer.

3. Create an iPython notebook called `Visualizing_data.ipynb` in which you address the 
following:
	
	a. Load a dataset related to your proposal topic into an iPython notebook using the 
	Python library you think is most appropriate for that dataset.
	
	b. Visualize the data using 3 different plots.
	
	d. Create another markdown cell in the notebook where you explain the following:
			* why you chose to visualize the data with the plots you chose
			* what new thing you learned about your data from the visualization
	
*note - all plots **must** have axis labels and legends where legends are appropriate*

4. [**Add**](http://gitref.org/basic/#add) and [**commit**](http://gitref.org/basic/#commit) 
changes to Git.

6. [**Push**](http://gitref.org/remotes/#push) the changes up to your copy of the 
repository on GitHub.

7. [Create a **pull request**](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) 
on the original repository to turn in the assignment.
